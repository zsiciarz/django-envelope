class ContactView(FormView):
    u"""
    Contact form view (class-based).

    Displays the contact form upon a GET request. If the current user is
    authenticated, ``sender`` and ``email`` fields are automatically filled
    with proper values.

    When the form is submitted and valid, a message is sent and afterwards
    the user is redirected to a "thank you" page (by default it is the page
    with the form).

    ``form_class``
        Which form class to use for contact message handling.
        The default (:class:`envelope.forms.ContactForm`) is often enough,
        but you can subclass it if you want, or even replace with a totally
        custom class. The only requirement is that your custom class has a
        ``save()`` method which should send the message somewhere. Stick to
        the default, or its subclasses.

    ``template_name``
        Full name of the template which will display
        the form. By default it is "envelope/contact.html".

    ``success_url``
        URL of the page with some kind of a "thank you
        for your feedback", displayed after the form is successfully
        submitted. If left unset, the view redirects to itself.
