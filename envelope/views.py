class ContactView(FormView):
    """
    Contact form view (class-based).

    Displays the contact form upon a GET request. If the current user is
    authenticated, ``sender`` and ``email`` fields are automatically
    filled with proper values.

    When the form is submitted and valid, a message is sent and
    afterwards the user is redirected to a "thank you" page (by default
    it is the page with the form).

    ``form_class``
        Which form class to use for contact message handling.
        The default (:class:`envelope.forms.ContactForm`) is often
        enough, but you can subclass it if you want, or even replace
        with a totally custom class. The only requirement is that your
        custom class has a ``save()`` method which should send the
        message somewhere. Stick to the default, or its subclasses.

    ``form_kwargs``
        Additional kwargs to be used in the creation of the form. Use
        with :class:`envelope.forms.BaseContactForm` form arguments for
        dynamic customization of the form.

    ``template_name``
        Full name of the template which will display
        the form. By default it is "envelope/contact.html".

    ``success_url``
        URL of the page with some kind of a "thank you
        for your feedback", displayed after the form is successfully
        submitted. If left unset, the view redirects to itself.

    ``messages``
        A tuple of message strings (invalid_message, valid_message) that should
        be sent when a request is processed. To disable a message, replace it
        with boolean False or empty string
