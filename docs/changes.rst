Improvements and fixes:

 - support for `custom User model`_
 - docs: added :doc:`cookbook`

Backwards incompatible changes:
 - removed category field from :class:`~envelope.forms.ContactForm`
 - ``BaseContactForm`` no longer exists; to customize form processing, subclass
   :class:`~envelope.forms.ContactForm` directly
 - :class:`~envelope.views.ContactView` does not create any flash messages;
   use `FormMessagesMixin`_ from  `django-braces`_ (see the :doc:`cookbook`
   for an example)
 - dropped Django 1.4 compatibility
 - dropped Python 2.6 compatibility; use 2.7 or 3.3+
 - message rejection reason from signal handlers isn't sent to the user in
   HTTP 400 response's body
 - the default ``envelope/contact.html`` template is removed; one must create
   the template explicitly
